Overall, this project had it's upsides and downsides.  
Generating and printing the maze took a significant amount of time with all it's intricacies.  
While we had the pseudocode for a general BFS and DFS, it was difficult to alter the pseudocode to 
fit this particular case of the maze.  Once we got BFS, DFS was simpler since it is essentially the 
same with stack's instead of queue's.  One other difficulty we encountered was finding what to test.
Since the maze was randomly generated, it was difficult to know what the actual maze was supposed to be. 
In the end, we checked if the hash printing was the same for BFS and DFS.  
Working in a group was not difficult and we were able to gain a new skill, GitHub, in the process.  
By splitting the work evenly it provided an opportunity for each of us to work on something specific, 
and we came together to generate and print the mazes.
